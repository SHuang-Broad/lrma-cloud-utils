  * setting up and maintaining Terra workspace tables,
  * submit workflows on Terra workspaces,
  * interacting with GCS,
  * sending out email notifications,
  * diagnosing failed [cromshell](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromshell/tree/cromshell_2.0) jobs.

`notebooks` contains example codes for using the library.
